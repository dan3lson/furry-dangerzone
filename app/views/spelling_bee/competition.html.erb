        Leksi is an online app that uses scientifically-backed methods to teach
        vocabulary in a fun environment. It is provided completely free for the
        duration of the Harlem Spelling Bee.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students will use Leksi to practice their grade’s 100 words by
            completing a variety of games and exercises. All activities were
            created following researched methods to ensure the students can
            learn and retain as they study
          </li>
          <li>
            Leksi will also provide the online exam for the Local School
            Competition. Those who score at the top of their school will be
            considered finalists

        Each grade will have 100 words. All words are grouped by grade and can
        be found within the Leksi app and in the resource section for
        teachers/coordinators.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Main Event, if all 100 words are used for a given
        grade, the next grade's words will be used.
      </p>
      <h4><%= emoji "muscle" %> Preparation</h4>
      <p>
