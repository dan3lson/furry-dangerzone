    Students will use Leksi, an online application, to learn their gradeâ€™s 100
    vocabulary words that will be used in the competition. The app uses
    scientifically backed methods to help instill an understanding of each
    individual word. Students will be able to practice for the Bee with the
    Leksi app and will take their Local School Competition via it. Leksi is
    provided completely free for your classroom while you prepare for the
    Spelling Bee.
