          This exciting event is a first of its kind for the entire Harlem
          community. The inaugural Harlem Spelling Bee
          was held in June 2017 at a KIPP NYC school, where 10 Finalists, out of
          150 enrolled students from 5 registered schools, competed to become
          the first Harlem Spelling Bee champs.
