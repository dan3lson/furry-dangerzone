        Schools enroll with the national office to ensure their students are
        eligible to participate and to receive the materials needed to conduct
        classroom and school bees. During enrollment, school bee coordinators
        receive their local sponsor's program-specific informationâ€”local dates,
        deadlines, and participation guidelines.</span>

        This spelling bee competition is indeed free! If you haven't signed your
        school up yet before the deadline,

        %>. This will ensure your school is participating and also give you and
        your students free accounts to use Leksi. With a Leksi account, students
        can practice their words in a fun way and you can track and support
        their progress along the way.

      <p>
        At every school, two (2) students will be selected from grades 1
        through 8. To determine how these 16
        students are selected, you must run a "local" spelling bee at your
        school. The winners from these local school competitions will then be
        set up to spell it out on the big stage.

      <p>
        One way your students can prepare for this spelling bee competition is
        by letting them use our online app, Leksi, which is free for you and
        your students after you

        the spelling bee list.
