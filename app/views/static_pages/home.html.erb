        <p class="lead">
          Using a research driven approach, Leksi helps students learn and use new
          vocabulary. Students are walked through multiple activities that help
          build and reinforce connections in the brain for each new word. The
          process brings them from basic activities, such as spelling vocabulary,
          to more complicated exercises such as composing a short story or poem.

          There’s a positive correlation between a student’s vocabulary size in
          grade 12, the likelihood that she will graduate from college, and her
          future level of income.

        Although it may not seem like it, the number of words that a child
        learns throughout their schooling is a key indicator of their future
        success. Simply put, the more vocabulary a child is exposed to, the
        better their chances at a brighter future.
      </p>
      <p>
        A strong vocabulary helps reading comprehension, which is invaluable
        as a student ages and deals with increasingly difficult
        assignments. If their vocabulary knowledge is limited early on, then
        their academics can suffer as they make their way through high school.
        This difficulty stops many students from attending college, and for
        others, it means they’re unable to graduate high school.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small vocabulary affects literacy. This can destroy
        <strong>any</strong> chance a student can have at a future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, with the right tools, one can expand their vocabulary. And at
        any age.

      <h1 class="display-4">The Leksi Road</h1>
      <p>
        For years, the most common way to learn vocabulary has been brute
        repetition, for example flashboards and memorization drills.
        Unfortunately, this style of learning comes at a cost. Often, a student
        can recite the word and its definition but does not possess a true
        concept of the meaning. So, if they encounter the word, they may
        recognize it, but fail to comprehend its intended purpose. This hurts
        literacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, Leksi takes a new approach. Based on scientific studies and years of
        research, the Leksi Road has students complete multiple activities of
        varying difficulty on their journey to master each new vocabulary term.
        From traditional memorization techniques (such as spelling) to our
        Leksi Tales and Word Relationship games, it’s an expedition designed to
        give a true understanding to our students.

        be to teach, we designed the Leksi Interface to be as friendly and
