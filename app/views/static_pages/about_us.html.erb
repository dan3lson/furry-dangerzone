    We believe students should be able to define their future.

    Leksi is an application that boosts student's vocabulary, a major
    indicator of student's success, in a fun and exciting way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leksi was created by Danelson Rosa

    who previously worked on Wall Street
    in various technology roles. Danelson wanted a way to solve his own
    vocabulary-related frustrations and just wasn't satisfied with
    any existing vocabulary apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leksi is still growing given the continuous testing and feedback from
    teachers, students, and the education community overall. Weâ€™re developing
    new features to engage, excite, and, of course, improve outcomes at the
    end of the day.
