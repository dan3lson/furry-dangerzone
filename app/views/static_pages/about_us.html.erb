      Leksi is an application that boosts student's vocabulary, a major
      indicator of student's success, in a fun and exciting way.
		</p>

		<p>
      Leksi was created by Danelson Rosa

      who previously worked on Wall Street
      in various technology roles. Danelson wanted a way to solve his own
      vocabulary-related frustrations and just wasn't satisfied with
      any existing vocabulary apps.
		</p>

		<p>
			Leksi is still growing given the continuous testing and feedback from
			teachers, students, and the education community overall. Weâ€™re developing new
			features to engage, excite, and, of course, improve outcomes at the end of
			the day.
		</p>

		<p>
			Happy learning!
