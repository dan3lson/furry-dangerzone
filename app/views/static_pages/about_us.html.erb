      We believe students should be able to define their future and that
      <em>vocabulary</em>, a major indicator of students' success, will help
      lead the way.

    Leksi began as a way to solve my personal frustrations
    when learning new vocabulary words: I wanted an app that helped me keep
    track of, organize, and learn words that I encountered. After looking
    around, I didnâ€™t find anything that stood out and met my expectations, so I
    decided to take matters into my own hands and create it myself.

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    As I learned
    more about the importance of vocabulary and the lack of time and instruction
    spent in and outside of the classrooms, it felt like I had an opportunity to
    make a big impact on students if only I could really execute on this idea.

    From where do our words come, you ask? Some Teachers create their own, but
    the majority come from

    and the
