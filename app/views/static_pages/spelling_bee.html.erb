      %>
      <p>
        It's great to hear you want to compete in this spelling bee! To sign
        up, first tell your teacher about this spelling bee competition. Your
        teacher has to be the one to register your school and the students -
        hopefully including you! - who will then go at it to become the spelling
        champ for your grade.
      </p>
      <%= render "static_pages/spelling_bee/question",
                 q: "Where are the words that will be used?"
      %>
      <p>
        Each grade from one through eight has 50 spelling bee words. All of the
        words are grouped by their grade level:
        <%= link_to "click here to view and/or print the words.", "#" %>
        Also, after your teacher registers your school, you will be given
        information to log into Leksi so that
        you can easily learn and practice all of these words. After you log in,
        just go to the "<i class="fa fa-search"></i> Look Up" page and
        add the words from any grade to your personal word list. Then complete
        all of the activities for each word.
      </p>
      <%= render "static_pages/spelling_bee/question",
                 q: "How can I practice my spelling?"
      %>
      <p>
        One way you can prepare for this spelling bee competition is by using
        Leksi, which is free. After your teacher registers your school,
        you should get information allowing you to log in and use Leksi.
        Once you have access to Leksi,
        you can easily learn and practice all of these words.
        Just go to the "<i class="fa fa-search"></i> Look Up" page and
        add the words from any grade to your personal word list. Then complete
        all of the activities for each word. The more time you put in, the
        better chances you'll have at winning. If you want to win, prove it.

        Schools enroll with the national office to ensure their students are
        eligible to participate and to receive the materials needed to conduct
        classroom and school bees. During enrollment, school bee coordinators

        deadlines, and participation guidelines.</span>

        your students free accounts to use Leksi. With a Leksi account, students
        can practice their words in a fun way and you can track and support
        their progress along the way.

      <p>
        At every school, two (2) students will be selected from grades 1
        through 8. To determine how these 16
        students are selected, you must run a "local" spelling bee at your
        school. The winners from these local school competitions will then be
        set up to spell it out on the big stage.

        This is the very first Harlem spelling bee, which promotes literacy
        and vocabulary development. We're excited about and focus on vocabulary
        because it's the biggest indicator of a student's success in and outside
        of the classroom. If we a want a stronger Harlem community that's more
        educated and econimically sound, we believe vocabulary - and your
        support - will help get us there.
