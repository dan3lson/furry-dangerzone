          It's up to you to take control of your vocabulary learning.
          When you see or hear a word you don't know, add it to your list.
          Having a personal dictionary is an effective tool for you to
          organize, manage, and learn words you don't know.
        </p>

          Leksi makes this easy by empowering you to find, add, and group words,
          which will make sure you don't forget a word and enhance your
          vocabulary study.

        We created game-like activities based on proven research. Our games
        motivate and really help you to build and retain new
        vocabulary. To master a word, complete the Basic, Intermediate, and
        Advanced games:
      </p>
      <div>
        <br>
        <h4>Basic</h4>
        <p>
          This game focuses on and has quiz-checkpoints for the basics of an
          individual word, i.e. spelling, meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and
          example sentences.
        </p>

        <br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Intermediate</h4>
        <p>
          This more challenging activity sharpens your knowledge of multiple
          words at the same time. For a word to reach the next game, you need to
          earn three of five hearts, i.e. answer three of five questions
          correctly.

          Unleash your creativity by using the words you've learned and create
          a short story, poem, rap, mad-lib - anything! If you share it
          publically, it could be featured in the Leksi Spotlight!
