						6 Words That Don't Mean What You Think

						Don't worry, you're not the only one. From family members and
            friends to co-workers and celebrities, many people incorrectly use
            words because they think it means one thing when it actually means
            another. Check out the six images below that we originally posted
            as a series on our
            Facebook
            and
            Twitter
            social media pages.
