# :book: Welcome to Leksi! :video_game:

Leksi is a web app that increases vocabulary, which leads to stronger reading
and writing skills. We focus on and :heart: vocabulary because it's a major
indicator of studentsâ€™ success in school and the "real world".

## How Does It Work?

Leksi features game-like activities based on a variety of empirical studies and
techniques on how to best learn new vocabulary. Because research tells us that
it takes 10-15 meaningful encounters with a word to truly learn it, Leksi's
systemic approach is based on this. More specifically,

### Students can

- Build a personal collection of words by looking up and saving words to their
personal list
- Organize their words with tags
- Learn and practice their words by completing over 10 (and growing!) game-like
activities for each respective one
- Track their progress, stats, and achievements each step of the way

### Teachers can

- Look up and add words on behalf of any one student or all of them
- Track an individual student's progress and their entire classrooms', too
- Provide feedback by reviewing and responding to the "freestyle" content that
students create as they complete some of the game-like activities
- Create their own content related to a word such as definitions, examples, or
other word details and feedback related to some of the game-like activities

### Admins can

- Do it all :laughing:, i.e. do everything any other user can do and view app
metrics

## Our Motivation

Our goal is to close the word gap with an app that not only improves student
outcomes through vocabulary development, but also is really easy and fun to use.
Founder Danelson Rosa came up with the original idea out of his own personal
frustrations when trying to learn new words. Through his research, he realized
the importance vocabulary truly has and how big of an impact it could have for
many different groups, especially K-12 students.

## Thought Process

As the product owner, my approach with Leksi has been to develop stronger
versions of the product with feedback and data...

- Create non-functional prototype with a tool called Axure
- Developed the first version of Leksi based on this prototype, which went
through many iterations after doing research, user testing, talking to folks in
the education community, etc.
- Iterated on a weekly to bi-weekly basis during a 10-week pilot with a school
in Manhattan
